# braindyn

### This is our Lab git

The main code base can be found in `/braindyn/`.

Inside this folder all main functions (e.g. to run multiple subjects or pipelines) should be placed. Remaining more specific functions or scripts should be placed within the respective subdirectory `/braindyn/<subdirectory>/`.

After writing a function or script, add a test file called `test_<scriptname>.py` to `/braindyn/tests/`.
