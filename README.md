Here we gather all the code we wrote



### discription of MEG pilot data:
=====================================

There are 4 files in total: 1st block, 2nd block, 3rd-4th block, 5-6th block. 
Thus, there were 6 blocks in total, with 42 trials in each block. Total N trials: 252.
There were 2 conditions: attend flicker (marker values 201-206) and ignore flicker (marker values 101-106).
Flicker frequencies used: 7 10 14 35 46 57 Hz.
Trial structure: 500 ms of static stimulus followed by 5 sec of flicker. Trial duration: 5.5 sec. ITI duration (after response): 1.2-1.5 sec.

__Marker values__:

_Ignore flicker:_ 101 - ignore 7 Hz; 102 - ignore 10 Hz; 103 - ignore 14 Hz; 104 - ignore 35 Hz; 105 - ignore 46 Hz; 106 - ignore 57 Hz.

_Attend flicker:_ 201 - attend 7 Hz; 202 - attend 10 Hz; 203 - attend 14 Hz; 204 - attend 35 Hz; 205 - attend 46 Hz; 206 - attend 57 Hz.

_Responses_: 11 and 10. Technically should be corrects and errors, but for this dataset they are all correct.

_Targets_: 245

_Start exp:_ 252

_End_exp:_ 253
